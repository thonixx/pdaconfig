# WARNING
Basically it is usable and configurable but it was not updated for a long time and it may contain security risks and other issues. Use it on your own.

# General info
secure_data.php and mysql_data.php are getting ignored from git to prevent commiting sensitive data. However I don't know if there are any other places with secure data. So double check before comitting.
